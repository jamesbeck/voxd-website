Voxd – WhatsApp AI Chatbot Platform Overview

Introduction

Voxd provides a powerful, enterprise-ready platform for delivering intelligent, automated conversations through WhatsApp. By combining WhatsApp Business integration, large language models (LLMs), and deep system integrations, Voxd enables organisations to communicate with customers in a natural, personal, and highly effective way—without requiring users to download apps, create accounts, or learn new interfaces.

The Voxd platform is designed to support sales, customer service, operations, and engagement use cases, while remaining flexible enough to adapt to the unique processes and data of each business.

WhatsApp-Based Chatbot Services

Voxd specialises in WhatsApp-based AI chatbots built on top of WhatsApp Business Accounts (WABAs).

WhatsApp Integration
• Voxd integrates directly with WhatsApp for Business using the Meta API.
• A secure webhook is configured for each WABA to receive incoming user messages in real time.
• Messages are reliably captured, stored, and processed by the Voxd platform.

Message Processing Flow 1. Message Reception
Incoming WhatsApp messages are received via the Meta webhook and saved into the Voxd database. 2. Queueing & Reliability
Messages are queued to ensure reliable processing, even during traffic spikes or external service delays. 3. AI Processing
Each message is processed by an AI agent using a configurable LLM provider and model. Voxd supports any LLM provider, allowing full flexibility and future-proofing. 4. Response Delivery
The AI-generated response is stored in the Voxd database and sent back to the user via the Meta Graph API. 5. Continuous Conversation
When the user replies, the process repeats, maintaining a consistent and contextual conversation.

AI Agent Capabilities

Each Voxd chatbot is powered by one or more AI agents, carefully designed to match the required business functionality.

Rich Contextual Prompting

For every message, the LLM receives a detailed, structured prompt that may include:
• An agent-specific system prompt defining personality, tone, rules, and objectives
• Full conversation history
• User data and historical context (e.g. name, preferences, previous orders)
• Information pulled from external systems (e.g. CRM records, account status, addresses)
• Access to tools that enable real-time interaction with back-office systems
• Access to unlimited knowledge sources such as:
• Policies and procedures
• FAQs and help content
• Product and service catalogues
• Menus, price lists, and general reference information

This approach ensures responses are accurate, personalised, and aligned with business rules.

Tool-Enabled Intelligence

AI agents are not limited to static responses. Through tools, they can:
• Query and update CRM systems
• Check order or booking status
• Create or modify records in internal systems
• Retrieve up-to-date information in real time

This enables true conversational automation rather than simple question-and-answer bots.

AI Workers and Background Automation

In addition to real-time message replies, Voxd supports AI Workers—separate processes that monitor and act on conversations outside the main reply loop.

What Are Workers?
• Workers are independent scripts, often AI-driven but not necessarily.
• They analyse conversations, user behaviour, and outcomes.
• They can trigger actions without requiring a user message.

Example Worker Use Cases
• Sentiment Monitoring
Detect unhappy or frustrated users and notify a human customer service representative.
• Sales Qualification
Identify high-intent users and pass their details to the sales team.
• Conversation Follow-Ups
Re-engage users after a conversation goes quiet.
• Operational Updates
Send order confirmations, delivery updates, or appointment reminders.

Scheduling & Messaging
• Workers can be scheduled to run at specific times or intervals.
• They can send messages to users when appropriate, allowing proactive engagement.

Outbound Messaging

Voxd supports both inbound and outbound WhatsApp messaging, fully compliant with Meta’s policies.

Message Types
• Template Messages (Cold Outreach)
Used when messaging a user who has not interacted in the last 24 hours. These must be pre-approved by Meta.
• Free-Form Messages (Active Conversations)
Allowed when the user has messaged the agent within the last 24 hours.

Cost Considerations
• Meta charges for outbound template (cold) messages.
• Messages sent within the active reply window are free.
