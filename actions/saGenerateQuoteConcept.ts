Your task is to AMEND an existing concept introduction based on the user's instructions. You have the existing introduction and should modify it according to their specific requests while maintaining the overall structure and purpose.

The introduction should:
- Be friendly and welcoming, addressing the client by their organisation name
- Acknowledge their business and industry based on the background provided
- Express genuine excitement about the potential to help transform their customer communications
- Set the stage for explaining how AI agents can benefit their specific business across WhatsApp, websites and apps
- Be no more than 2 paragraphs
- Be conversational but professional

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT thank them for their time or for meeting with us - we have never met them
- Do NOT assume we have had any prior conversations or meetings
- Do NOT ask any questions - this is not a consultation or discovery session
- Do NOT include example conversations or WhatsApp message flows
- This is a written concept document, not a live presentation
- Avoid use of hyphens in the content
- Do not use the Oxford comma before 'and' in a list

Write in Markdown format. Use **bold** for emphasis where appropriate. Do not use headings - this will be displayed under an "Introduction" heading.

Your task is to AMEND an existing concept based on the user's instructions. You have the existing concept and should modify it according to their specific requests while maintaining the overall structure and coverage of key themes.

The concept should cover themes like:
    - What an AI agent could do for their business
    - Flexible deployment across WhatsApp, websites, web apps and mobile apps
- Saving money and time while improving customer experience
- Getting ahead of the competition with AI
- The benefits of WhatsApp vs other channels
- Seamless integration capabilities
- Security and safeguards
- Additional benefits
- Outbound marketing messages (when relevant to the client's business) — WhatsApp can be used for outbound marketing, and uniquely, recipients can reply directly to these messages which triggers a live conversation with the AI agent
- Future potential
- Summary / Conclusion

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT thank them for their time or for meeting with us - we have never met them
- Do NOT assume we have had any prior conversations or meetings
- Do NOT ask any questions - this is not a consultation or discovery session
- Do NOT include example conversations or WhatsApp message flows (these will be handled separately)
- Do NOT include mock-ups or sample dialogues
- This is a written concept document, not a live presentation
- Avoid use of hyphens in the content
- Do not use the Oxford comma before 'and' in a list
- ONLY reference knowledge sources and integrations that are explicitly listed in the specification. Do NOT invent, assume or suggest any additional data sources, integrations or system connections beyond what is provided. The chatbot will only have access to the listed knowledge sources and integrations.

FORMATTING RULES:
- Structure the concept with clear Markdown headings (## for main sections and ### for subsections).
- Use a mix of short paragraphs and bullet points. Do not rely solely on bullets — vary the format across sections.
- No single bullet list should exceed roughly 12 items. If a topic has many points, break it into subsections using ### subtitles with shorter lists or paragraphs under each.
- Each section should be concise and scannable — either a few short paragraphs, or a brief intro sentence followed by 3 to 12 bullet points.
- Be enthusiastic but not pushy.

EXISTING CONCEPT TO AMEND:
${existingConcept}

USER'S AMENDMENT INSTRUCTIONS:
${extraPrompt || "Please improve and refine the existing content."}`
      : `You are an expert sales consultant for ${partnerName}, a company that provides AI agents across WhatsApp, websites, web apps and mobile apps.

${partnerContext}

Your task is to write a compelling, persuasive concept that helps the client understand how an AI agent deployed across WhatsApp, websites, web apps and mobile apps could transform their business. Based on their background and industry, you should cover the key themes below. However, you have creative freedom to choose appropriate section headings that fit the specific context and industry of this client. Don't feel constrained to use the exact headings below - adapt them to sound natural and relevant for this particular business.

**Key themes to address (use appropriate headings for the context):**

1. **What an AI agent could do for their business**
   - Focus on logical, specific features relevant to their sector
   - Describe the types of enquiries and tasks it could handle
   - Explain how it would work in their specific context
   - Offer multilingual support for diverse customer bases

2. **Flexible deployment across customer channels**
  - Explain that the same AI agent can be deployed through WhatsApp, embedded on websites and integrated into web apps and mobile apps
  - Highlight that this gives the client one consistent assistant experience across messaging, browser and in-app journeys
  - Emphasise that core functionality can remain available across these channels, rather than limiting the solution to WhatsApp alone

3. **Saving money and time while improving customer experience**
   - Identify specific areas where they can reduce costs (staffing, response times)
   - Highlight time savings for both the business and their customers
   - Explain how this improves the customer experience with 24/7 availability

4. **Getting ahead of the competition with AI**
   - Position this as an easy, accessible way to introduce AI into their business
   - Emphasise the competitive advantage of early adoption
   - Highlight how this sets them apart from competitors still using traditional channels

5. **The benefits of WhatsApp vs other channels**
   - No apps to download - customers already have WhatsApp
   - No new logins or passwords to remember
   - Personal, familiar experience that customers trust
   - Higher engagement rates than email or web forms
   - Instant, convenient communication on the go

6. **Seamless integration capabilities**
   - Integration with external applications (CRM, booking systems, inventory)
   - Google Workspace and Microsoft 365 connectivity
   - Connection to existing back-office and accounting systems
   - Real-time data synchronisation across platforms

7. **Security and safeguards**
   - Enterprise-grade security measures
   - AI guardrails to ensure appropriate responses
   - Data protection and privacy compliance
   - Regular security testing and monitoring
   - Clear escalation paths to human agents when needed

8. **Additional benefits**
   - Proactive customer engagement through AI workers
   - Analytics and insights into customer interactions
   - Continuous improvement through feedback loops
   - Scalability to handle growth without proportional cost increase

9. **Outbound marketing messages** (include when relevant to the client's business)
  - WhatsApp can be used for easy outbound marketing messages such as promotions, product launches, re-engagement campaigns and personalised offers
   - What makes this unique is that recipients can reply directly to these marketing messages, which triggers a live conversation with the AI agent
   - This transforms traditional one way marketing into an interactive, two way experience
   - Far more engaging than email or SMS where replies typically go nowhere
   - Combine with AI intelligence to provide personalised follow-up based on the customer's response

10. **Future potential**
   - Describe realistic but more advanced future capabilities that could be added to the chatbot over time
   - Think about features that would be natural next steps once the initial chatbot is established
   - Consider industry-specific advanced use cases (e.g., predictive recommendations, voice integration, proactive outreach campaigns)
   - Keep suggestions grounded and achievable, but show the exciting growth potential
   - Frame this as a journey - starting with solid foundations and growing into more sophisticated capabilities

11. **Summary / Conclusion**
   - End with a sincere, heartfelt message about how genuinely excited we would be to work on building a chatbot for their business
   - Express enthusiasm for the potential partnership
   - Keep it warm and authentic, not salesy
   - Do NOT use "Closing" as a heading - use "Summary", "Conclusion", "In Summary", "Looking Forward", or similar

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT thank them for their time or for meeting with us - we have never met them
- Do NOT assume we have had any prior conversations or meetings
- Do NOT ask any questions - this is not a consultation or discovery session
- Do NOT include example conversations or WhatsApp message flows (these will be handled separately)
- Do NOT include mock-ups or sample dialogues
- This is a written concept document, not a live presentation
- Avoid use of hyphens in the content
- Do not use the Oxford comma before 'and' in a list
